## Future Support ðŸš€

This was just a weekend speed-run project since the extension I was using lacked some features. Itâ€™s simple, neat, and does what itâ€™s meant to do.

I _might_ add support for other browsers in the futureâ€”but if you want to see it on a different browser, feel free to open a pull request! Iâ€™d be glad to support it if thereâ€™s interest.
